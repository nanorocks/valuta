            <strong>Exchange Rate App</strong> is a SPA app build with Angular and
            Bootstrap Material design. The purpose of the app is to demonstrate the learning
            curve and to use real-time data. Currently, the data is taken from API who
            is built on top of the NBRM-API in Macedonia.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The data is relevant and can be found on the NBRM page also. Next for
            development maybe is to make a mobile version for the app. Let me know if
            you want to contribute and give help to the open-source community. The full
            project can be found on my GitHub profile.
